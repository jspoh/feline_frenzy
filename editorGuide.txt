1. Introduction

Welcome to the Level Editor Guide! This document will help you navigate the editor's features and guide you in creating and modifying levels for your game. Follow the instructions in each section to get familiar with the editor.

2. Interface Overview

- Right-click on entities for a context menu to perform quick actions like deletion or duplication.

File Management
The File Management shows all the assets loaded into your project, such as textures, prefabs, shaders, models, and audio files. Use the folders to navigate between different asset types:  

- Textures: Displays all texture files. Drag a texture into the viewport to create a new entity.
- Audio: Contains audio files for background music and sound effects.
- Scene:  
  - View and manage .scn files (scene files).  
  - Save the current scene or load an existing one directly from this tab.

Important Note: Textures and other assets are automatically categorized. Dragging them into the viewport will automatically create an entity.

- Collapsible Sections: Each component type has its own collapsible section.  
- Editable Properties: Modify properties such as position, rotation, scale, and other component-specific settings.
